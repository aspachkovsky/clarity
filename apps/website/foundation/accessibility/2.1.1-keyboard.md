[WCAG Guideline 2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard)

##### Requirement

Every component and action (even hidden ones) needs to be reachable from the keyboard.

##### Reasons

Not everyone can use a mouse.

##### Details

1.  Swipe only behavior is specifically disallowed. It doesn't matter that you've seen it elsewhere, they are either a) out of compliance or b) the compliance rules don't apply that app/website.
1.  Hover information cannot contain any content that isn't available elsewhere since it is not possible to make it keyboard accessible.
1.  Swipe left to delete hidden actions must also have a keyboard equivalent
1.  Minimum keys that must be conditionally supported include:
    * **Tab** - Using the tab key, the keyboard focus should move through all interactive elements on the page.
    * **Shift + Tab** - Does the same as using the tab key, but youâ€™re driving in reverse with the shift key.
    * **Enter/Return** - Follows a link, activates (presses) a button or selects an item from a list.
    * **Spacebar** - Toggles checkbox values, activates buttons.
    * **Arrow Keys** - Scrolls content, moves/selects radio buttons within a group, sometimes moves between interactive menu items or tab panels, navigates to next or previous item on a combo box.
