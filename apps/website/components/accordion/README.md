::: summary
An accordion allows generic content to be collapsed and allows users to expand to show more detail.
:::

Accordions are designed for use in the main content area. Use an accordion when you want to progressively disclose data. This is useful when the set of information is large or you want to enable users to reveal more complex or less frequently used data as necessary.
